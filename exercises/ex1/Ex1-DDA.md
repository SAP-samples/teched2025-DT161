## 2. What is a scope item?

Before we jump in we need to understand what a 'scope item' is.

> A scope item is a pre-configured, modular business process that provides a complete, activated set of functionalities for core business scenarios, like finance or human resources. These pre-built scope items, found in SAP Best Practices Explorer, accelerate implementation by offering ready-to-use "best practice" processes instead of starting from scratch.
More information for all scope items can be found on the [SAP Signavio Process Navigator](https://me.sap.com/processnavigator/SolS/EARL_SolS-013/2508?region=DE).

## 3. Select Baseline package

Lets accelerate the scope selection and browse to the pre-selection packages.

1. Open the section `Pre-selection packages`.
2. Select the bundle `Baseline`.

## 4. Export Excel for CALM & JSON for CBC

In order to proceed with the actual implementation of SAP Cloud ERP we need to extract the JSON and Excel files that need to be imported into the next steps.

Early 2026 these steps will be automated but right now this involves a manual download and upload into the respective tools.

1. Navigate to the results section
2. Click on the Excel export button and save locally
3. Click on the JSON export button and save locally
